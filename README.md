## Results and Demonstrations

This project provides foundational examples for accelerating materials discovery. The `accelerated_materials_discovery.py` script demonstrates a simple property prediction using linear regression, showcasing the basic principle of using AI for materials science. Future work will involve more complex models and integration with experimental data.

## Future Work

*   Implement advanced machine learning models (e.g., deep learning) for property prediction.
*   *   Integrate with materials databases (e.g., Materials Project) for data acquisition.
    *   *   Develop generative models for designing new materials with target properties.
        *   *   Explore high-throughput simulation techniques (e.g., DFT) for data generation.
